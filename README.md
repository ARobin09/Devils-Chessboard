# The Devil's Chessboard
## Overview
You and a fellow human are transported to hell by The Devil. In order to escape, you must play one of his favorite games. If you win, you and your friend wil be granted freedom. However, if you lose, you will be trapped forever.

<p> You are ushered into a room containing a chessboard with 64 squares. On each square, there is coin that is flipped to <mark>heads(H)</mark> or <mark>tails(T)</mark>. The Devil then hides a key under one of the coins. You must flip <b>one and only one</b> coin and leave. Your friend then comes in and must decide which coin contains the key. They only have <b>one</b> guess. If they get it right, you win!</p>

<p>Can you solve this puzzle?</p>

### Notes
- You can collaborate with your friend beforehand to come up with a strategy. You cannot communicate during the game.
- The chessboard can be in any starting cnfiguration. It could be all heads, all tails, half and half... whatever The Devil chooses.
- You MUST flip exactly one coin. You cannot flip any more or less.
- You cannot do any "sneaky tactics" (flipping a coin on its side, rotating a coin, tilting the board, leaving clues on the wall, secret communication, etc.). The Devil will notice and you will immediately lose the game.
- It may be helpful to work with smaller cases.
- Don't give up! You got this!
